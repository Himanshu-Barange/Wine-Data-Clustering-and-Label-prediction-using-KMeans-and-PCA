# Description
**Data Source:** Kaggle
**Libraries Utilized:** Sklearn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

- The sourced dataset was already in clean.
- Normalized the feature vectors.
- Detemined the 'k' using Elbow method
- Also utilized Silhouette Score plot for better selection of 'k'
- Sklearn's default initialization method was used for initializing the k centroids
- Created the final model with 4 clusters
- Predicted the labels for some unseen portion of the dataset using the model created
- Visualized the clusters by reducing dimensionality from the original 13 to 2 principal components.
